# learning-git
A repo for git learning.

The teaching material lives on the gh-pages branch, so that it will be auto-published [here](https://walquis.github.io/learning-git).

In November 2020, I changed the course for Mike platoon to make it more useful:  I taught the basics of this material in session 1, then used https://github.com/walquis/tags to run a simulated project in session 2.

I didn't actually use this repo at all, besides the published gh-pages branch and a couple scripts for setting aliases and unpacking objects.

Probably, this repo should be merged into that repo: the gh-pages branch, along with the scripts.
